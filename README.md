# MOJO
This is a team project for Deep Learning practical training carried out in the K-Digital AI Service Dev course. MOJO is a web/mobile application providing the food image classification service for those who are not familiar with Korean food. The name MOJO derives from the simplified pronunciation of the Korean sentence "*이게 뭐죠? [Ige mwojo?]*" meaning "What's this?", meaning that users can always ask what food is in front of them.

In this page, we provide you the source codes which we used for the model define and training.
